Description: Deluge GTK UI
 Deluge is a full-featured, multi-platform, multi-interface BitTorrent client
 using libtorrent-rasterbar in it's backend and featuring multiple
 user-interfaces: GTK+, web and console.
 .
 It has been designed using the client-server model with a daemon process that
 handles all the BitTorrent activity. The Deluge daemon is able to run on
 headless machines with the user-interfaces being able to connect remotely
 from any platform.
 .
 You may want to install this package to use the Deluge GTK+ user-interface
 as a thin client and connect to a remote daemon.

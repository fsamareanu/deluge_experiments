# Packaging for Windows

Currently there is no working package for Deluge 2.0. The previous Python freezing
application `bbfreeze` is not compatible with Python 3 and the project is no longer
maintained.

There are two alternatives `cxfreeze` and `pyinstaller` but neither is trivial with
the GTKUI application.
